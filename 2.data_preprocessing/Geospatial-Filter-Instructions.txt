The original unprocessed images are in the "E:\\TrashTracker\\Trash_Images_Originals" folder on the external hard drive. Within this folder there are sub-folders for each survey day (e.g., 'Survey_20170809'), then multiple sub-folders within each survey day (e.g., '100GOPRO') with about 1000 images each. The process below copies the distinct images (ones that are greater than a set distance from the previous image) from a given sub-folder to a new location where they can be filtered and processed. 

Instructions:
1. Open the 'Geospatial-Filter.R' script in RStudio
2. In the script, enter the name of the survey day you're currently working on into the 'survey_day' variable (e.g., 'Survey_20170809'), and enter the name of the survey subfolder you're ready to start working on into the 'survey_subfolder' variable
3. In RStudio, click the 'Source' button (towards the upper right side of window) to run the script - this gets the GPS coordinates and timestamp of each image and selects only distinct images (images that are further than a given tolerace from the previous image), and copies the distinct images into a new folder. This destination folder is defined by the 'filtered_images_folder' variable (e.g., 'Filtered-Images-2019-10'), and uses the same survey day/subfolder structure as the original images (e.g., 'E:\TrashTracker\Filtered-Images-2019-10\Survey_20170809\100GOPRO').
4. Within the folder created in the previous step, filter through the images and delete ones that don't have any clearly visible trash, retaining the images that do have trash (note that it's okay if you miss/delete some images that do contain trash)
5. When you finish filtering through a subfolder, go back to step 2 and enter the new 'survey_day' and 'survey_subfolder' info (if RStudio is already open, restart it or clear out the variables to be safe)
